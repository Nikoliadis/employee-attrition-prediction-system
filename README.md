# Employee Attrition Prediction System

This project analyzes employee data to predict attrition using machine learning models.
It is developed as part of the CLD6000 – Contemporary Problem Analysis module (University of Bolton / NYC).

## Objective
To investigate how accurately ML models can predict employee turnover
and identify which features most influence attrition.

## Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Power BI / Tableau (for visualization)
- GitHub for version control

## Dataset
IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance  
Source: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)

## Research Question
**How accurately can machine learning models predict employee attrition, 
and which features are most influential in prediction?**
